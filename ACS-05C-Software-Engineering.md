# Slide Number: 6

## Description
The slide offers recommendations for command-line tools for using Git, with comments on older versions of Windows such as "Windows 7-8 – You shouldn’t be using these anymore. They are EOL." and "Prev. Win. – …What is wrong with you?". These remarks may be seen as unprofessional and could potentially confuse or offend students not familiar with the term "EOL" (End of Life).

## Possible Fix
Revise the language to maintain a professional and informative tone. For example: "Windows 7-8 – These versions are no longer supported (End of Life) and should not be used." Remove subjective comments like "What is wrong with you?".

## Description
The pseudocode provided on this slide is for a 'monkey sort' algorithm, which is known for its inefficiency and generally used as a humorous example to illustrate poor algorithm performance. While entertaining, it might not adequately convey the importance of efficient algorithm design or sorting algorithms in practical applications.

## Possible Fix
Include a more standard and practically useful sorting algorithm alongside the monkey sort for comparative purposes. This will help students understand the practical implications and efficiency differences between algorithms. Adding a brief explanation of why monkey sort is inefficient could also be beneficial.
