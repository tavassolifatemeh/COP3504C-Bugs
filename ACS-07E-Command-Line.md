# Slide Number: 6

## Description
The presentation discusses the use of GCC for compiling C++ code but shows a potentially incorrect command format with an en dash â€“ instead of a hyphen - in the compilation options. This typographical error is common when text is copied from formatted documents and can lead to command-line errors.

## Possible Fix
Correct the dash in the GCC compilation command example to use a hyphen. It should be g++ main.cpp scheme.cpp -o conquer. Additionally, include a note about ensuring the correct syntax is used in command-line interfaces to avoid similar issues.

# Slide Number: 7

## Description
The slide provides a brief explanation of Makefiles and how they simplify the build process, but it lacks depth in explaining how errors can occur if commands are not properly indented with a tab. This might cause students to encounter errors without understanding why, especially if they manually type or edit Makefiles.

## Possible Fix
Expand the content on Makefiles to include common errors, such as the significance of tab indentation versus spaces. Provide a clear example showing a correct and an incorrect Makefile to illustrate the importance of this formatting.
