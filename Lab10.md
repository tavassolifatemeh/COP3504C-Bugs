## Description
In labs like this one where files are provided, it is unclear how to setup your filepaths for grading by the TAs.

## Possible Fix
Perhaps add a line at the end of these types of labs that say that the file path should begin at /images and that to test it you must move your images file to the cmake folder.

## Description
Ambiguity on what full complement should look like. Even though it says to get it to look like the sample images, if you do full complement the output might be different than expected.

## Possible Fix
Add an image for full complement to make sure there is no ambiguity on what is expected to get full points.
