# Slide Number: 16

## Description
In 4C Binary Search, in the recap slide there are grammatical errors. In the first point, " We sort data to making finding data faster". Adding it here because there was not another page for it.

## Possible Fix
Change the wording to "We sort data to make finding data faster."
