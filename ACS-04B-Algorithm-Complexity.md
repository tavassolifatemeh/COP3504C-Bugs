## Description
The pseudocode for the is_prime function is written as for divisor in range(2 n):, which is missing a comma, making the syntax incorrect.

## Possible Fix
Correct the syntax error in the pseudocode by adding a comma between the parameters in the range function: for divisor in range(2, n):.
