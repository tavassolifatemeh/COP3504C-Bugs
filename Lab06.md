## Description
It is not clear that CLion users will have to run command line arguments through Clion run configurations when it says to run command line arguments. 

## Possible Fix
I suggest a short addendum mentioning that to test your code in CLion using cmd you must use the "run configuratons" button. I know several other students who got stuck on this for a while.
