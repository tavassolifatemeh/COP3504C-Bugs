# Slide Number: 26
## Description
The discussion on null pointers and their behavior might not sufficiently cover the dangers of using uninitialized or null pointers, potentially leading to runtime errors. The slide mentions that using a null pointer can throw an exception, but it does not elaborate on how to handle such exceptions or the importance of checking pointers before use.

## Possible Fix
Expand the content to include best practices for handling pointers, especially checking for null before dereferencing. Provide examples of safe pointer usage and how to implement checks to prevent accessing null pointers, which can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
