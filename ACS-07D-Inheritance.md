# Slide Number: 4

## Description
The slide provides an example of using inheritance in C++, specifically highlighting a person inheriting from a car, which is used to illustrate an incorrect use of inheritance. However, the example might be confusing and mislead students about the correct use of inheritance.

## Possible Fix
Clarify this example by contrasting it with a correct use of inheritance. Explain why inheriting 'Person' from 'Car' is conceptually incorrect, reinforcing the proper use of the "is-a" relationship in object-oriented programming.

# Slide Number: 6

## Description
The presentation briefly mentions private inheritance but does not adequately explain how it differs from other types of inheritance, such as public and protected. This lack of detail could leave students with an incomplete understanding of inheritance types.

## Possible Fix
Expand the discussion on different types of inheritance. Provide clear examples that show the practical differences between public, protected, and private inheritance, including how each type affects access to base class members in derived classes.
