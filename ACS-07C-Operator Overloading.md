# Slide Number: 6

## Description
The code snippet provided in the slide has syntax issues, such as int x y z;, which are not valid C++ and could lead students to write incorrect code. This kind of error might also make the slide appear unprofessional or poorly reviewed.

## Possible Fix
Revise the slide to ensure that all code snippets are syntactically correct. Each variable declaration should be separated properly, e.g., int x; int y; int z;. Additionally, adding comments or further explanations might help clarify the correct usage of syntax in C++.

# Slide Number: 7

## Description
The slide presents an example of operator+ for a class Vector3 where the operator modifies the object and returns void. This example, intended to illustrate a bad practice, might not be clear enough about why such an implementation is problematic, potentially confusing students on best practices for operator overloading.

## Possible Fix
Clarify why modifying the object within an operator+ and returning void is bad practice. Explain the importance of maintaining immutability for binary operators and returning a new object instead. Enhance the slide with a comparison to a correctly implemented operator+ that returns a new Vector3 object.
